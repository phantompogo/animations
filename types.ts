// This file can be used for any global types or enums shared across the application.
// For now, AlertType enum is co-located with AlertMessage.tsx for better modularity.

// Example of a global type (if needed in the future):
// export interface UserProfile {
//   id: string;
//   username: string;
//   email: string;
// }

export {}; // Ensures this file is treated as a module.
